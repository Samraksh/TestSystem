# GNU MCU Eclipse ARM Embedded GCC

This is the **GNU MCU Eclipse** (formerly GNU ARM Eclipse) version of the 
[GNU Arm Embedded Toolchain](https://developer.arm.com/open-source/gnu-toolchain/gnu-rm).

## Easy install

The **GNU MCU Eclipse ARM Embedded GCC** toolchain is also available as a binary [xPack](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@gnu-mcu-eclipse/arm-none-eabi-gcc) and can be conveniently installed with [xpm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/xpm):

```console
$ xpm install @gnu-mcu-eclipse/arm-none-eabi-gcc --global
```

For more details on how to install the toolchain, please see [How to install the ARM toolchain?](http://gnu-mcu-eclipse.github.io/toolchain/arm/install/) page.

## Compliance

This release closely follows the official ARM distribution, as described in the original ARM release text files:

- `gnu-mcu-eclipse/arm-readme.txt`
- `gnu-mcu-eclipse/arm-release.txt`

## Changes

Compared to the ARM distribution, the build procedure is more or less the same and there should be no functional differences.

## Compatibility

The binaries were built using [xPack Build Box (XBB)](https://github.com/xpack/xpack-build-box), a set of build environments based on slightly older systems that should be compatible with most recent systems.

- GNU/Linux: all binaries built with GCC 7.2, running in a CentOS 6 Docker container
- Windows: all binaries built with mingw-w64 GCC 7.2, running in a CentOS 6 Docker container 
- macOS: all binaries built GCC 7.2, running in a custom Homebrew instance on macOS 10.10.5, except GDB which was built with Apple clang, since neither building with GCC 7 or GCC 6 produced functional binaries (SIGABRT for `set language auto`)

## Build

The scripts used to build this distribution are in:

- `gnu-mcu-eclipse/scripts`

For the prerequisites and more details on the build procedure, please see the [How to build the ARM Embedded GCC binaries?](http://gnu-mcu-eclipse.github.io/toolchain/arm/build-procedure/) page. 

## Documentation

The original PDF documentation is available in:

- `share/doc/pdf`
